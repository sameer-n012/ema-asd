# Employee Management Application
### Sameer Narendran & Evan Sun

### Description
This is a graphical application made with Java Swing that can help an employer effectively manage employees. The application has several views including the Login View, Employer View, Add/Modify View, Employee View, Log View, and Add Log View. The Login View allows employees and employers to log in and allows employers to create a new company in the application. The Employer View allows the employer to see a list of all employees, select certain employees to modify or delete, and add new employees. The Add/Modify View is where the employer can modify the employee data such as shifts, salary, and perform a password reset, and is also where the employer will fill out information when creating a new employee. The Employee View is where the employee can see their profile and modify values such as name and password. The Log View allows the employer to see a list of all logs for a particular company and who made them. The Add Log View allows the employee to fill out information for adding a log including date and description, and also allows the employer to view logs and mark them as verified. 

Due to the constraints of the project, there is no storage of data apart from the application memory, therefore the application is reset every time it is run. If this were a professional project, the data would be stored in a database on a server and would be retrieved in order to appear on the application. The default password that we decided to use when a new employee is created or when the employer resets the password is "password". It is the responsibility of the employee to change it after being set to the default.

### Pre-Populated Data
The application is pre-populated with data for demonstration purposes. 

The employer Sameer Narendran (username: "snarendran", password: "admin") in the company First Inc contains employees A a (username: "a", password: "password"), B b (username: "b", password: "password"), and so on up until the letter j. 

The employer Evan Sun (username: "esun", password: "admin") in the company Last Inc contains employees X x (username: "x", password: "password"), Y y (username: "y", password: "password"), and Z z (username: "z", password: "password")
