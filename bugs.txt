SATURDAY - unable to replicate bug, could be because of using it on monitor?

Duplicate users in different companies - users with the same username can be created in separate companies and there's no real way to deal with it - solved

Creating a user with the same username as another company owner will delete the company user from the database(created new user sn, could not login as sn, CEO of First Inc.) - same problem as previous, prevented duplicate users
